**Ans:**
**1. Difference between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll:**
a. getElementById: 
By getElementById("idName") we can select one element by it's id.

b. getElementsByClassName:
By getElementsByClassName we can select all elements with the same class.

c. querySelector:
By querySelector we can select the first element that matches a CSS selector.

d. querySelectorAll:
By querySelectorAll we can select all elements that match a CSS selector.



**2. How we create and insert a new element into the DOM:**
By Create & insert element we can make a new element and add it to the page.



**3. Event Bubbling and how it works**
Event starts on the element and moves up to parents.



**4. Event Delegation in JavaScript? Why is it useful:**
Handle events on parent for its child elements.

Event Delegation is useful because:
a. Less code 
b. Works for dynamic elements
c. Better performance



**5. Difference between preventDefault() and stopPropagation() methods:**
a. preventDefault():
Basically, it stops the elementâ€™s default action.

b. stopPropagation()
Baiscally, it stops the event from reaching parent elements.
